# Homework: Heron's Formula

Ask the user to input the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The lengths can be decimal (floating-point) values.

After receiving the side lengths, use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.

To make things a bit more interesting, find the formula yourself.

Once the area is calculated, display the result in the console.
